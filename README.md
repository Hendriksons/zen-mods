### How to install
Copy this:
```json
,{"sidebar-expand":{"id":"sidebar-expand","name":"Sidebar Expand on Hover","description":"Readds the expand on hover feature to zen with a few extra features","homepage":"https://github.com/Hendriksons/zen-mods/tree/main/sidebar-expand-on-hover","style":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hendriksons/zen-mods/refs/heads/main/sidebar-expand-on-hover/chrome.css","readme":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hendriksons/zen-mods/refs/heads/main/sidebar-expand-on-hover/README.md","image":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hendriksons/zen-mods/refs/heads/main/sidebar-expand-on-hover/screenshot.png","author":"Hendriksons  & Uriel","version":"1.2.7","tags":[],"createdAt":"2024-12-10","updatedAt":"2025-06-26","preferences":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Hendriksons/zen-mods/refs/heads/main/sidebar-expand-on-hover/preferences.json","enabled":true}}
```
Go to **about:profiles** and go visit the directory of the profile for which you want to install. \
In the directory search and open the **zen-themes.json** file and append the copied json between the last two paretheses\
Save the file\
Restart the Browser\
Now the mod should lowkey work

### I do not plan on upstreaming it for obvious reasons
